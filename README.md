# Well Design & Architecture

A repository for a (hopefully soon to be) a package that vizualizes a wellbore with pertinent information. 

The codes allow users to add various well construction elements (such as casings and cements) with simple object definitions and calls. Thus, a well is simply a collection of element objects. More well construction elements to come (depends if I have free time or not lmao ðŸ˜…). Current result looks like something below
